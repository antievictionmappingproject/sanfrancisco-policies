    <h4><b>Rent control</b> is effective at keeping people in their homes. 
      Rent control policies limit rent increases and provide greater housing stability for tenants. 
      Rent control ordinances in California allow landlords to set the initial rent in any amount, 
      but limit rent increases after a tenancy begins. </h4>
    <h4>Rent control is often combined with eviction protections, known as 
      <b>"just cause for eviction,"</b> to make sure that landlords do not get around
      the rent increase limits by simply evicting tenants arbitrarily and bringing in new tenants. 
      Just Cause protections provide basic fairness and prevent retaliation, discrimination, and harassment proactively.</h4>

      Landlords can also petition for other increases. Notably, capital improvements can be passed 
      through to the tenant for a maximum increase of 10%
      or increased operating and maintenance costs for a maximum increase of 7%, but these rent 
      increases must be documented and approved by the Rent Board before they can be imposed. 
      The tenant can request a hardship exemption for the capital improvement and operating and maintenance passthroughs.</p><p>
      Tenants can petition the Rent Board to decrease their rent if the landlord has failed to provide 
      agreed upon or legally required services—e.g., the landlord takes away storage space, parking, 
      washer/dryer, etc. or the landlord fails to maintain the premises as safe and habitable 
      (e.g. the apartment has uncorrected housing code violations).</p>
